            <p>I have a total of, close to 7 years of experience in various fields, 
                in various roles in India. I started as an proof reader in a book store during 2003, and

            <h4>First job</h4>
            <p>I joined as a proof reader in book store in my home town called Madurai. I worked for 6 months.
                And i moved to a computer hardware selling dealer shop as an office assistant. My responsibilities
                were tele-calling, accounts, stock maintenance and billing. Worked there for a year.
                Then i joined as a store keeper in a Nokia priority showroom where my responsibilities were to 
                run the store, taking care of billing, sales, tele-calling. Then i joined 
                <a href="https://www.sutherlandglobal.com/" target="_blank">Sutherland global services</a>,
                it is a BPO in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai" target="_blank">Chennai</a>,
                where i worked for closed to 5-1/2years in hp, dell and Acer laptops customer
                and technical support. So i know troubleshooting laptops that has Windows OS.
            </p>
           
            <h4>The job i loved doing</h4>
            <p>I joined sutherland global Services as a customer support associate. I was handling calls in 
                an OOW(Out of warranty) support where i need to take minimum of 90calls per day, and do sales
                conversion. Maintain the AHT(Avergae handling time) of 5 to 7 mins. I was there for 4 months, then
                i got transferred to hp laptops tech support. And so i groomed myself as a technical support
                associate. This is the place, where i learnt the customer handling skills, technical skills, 
                telephone etiquettes. After a year and a half of being a FLA(Front line agent), i got promoted
                as a call back associate, and then as an ASG(Agent support group). So i have handled a team of 
                around 25 associates along with couple of ASGs and a TL(Team leader). After 3 years of working with
                hp, moved to dell laptops as L2(Supervisor). The roles and responsibilities were more or less the
                same, only difference was the parameters that we would be weighed on. I worked for dell laptops,
                for around 10 months and moved to Acer-laptops, as a SME(Subject Matter Expert). Though it was
                a pilot project, i had no different responsibilities other than training newbies(fresh from college).
                In those 5 years, i gained vast knowledge in handling laptops and it's consumers and also
                enhanced my communication skills.
